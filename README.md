# Solitaire
Classic solitaire game wrote in C++ using miniwin graphic interface
I tried to use polymorphism and inheritance. My problem is that the game has some bugs when you try to move some cards. It doesn't appear always but if you try the game for around 10 minutes you will see what I'm talking about.
